# SubwaySurfers
Subway Surfers like game made with unity. 

This project was made for a university assignment in my Advanced Computer Lab course, It is a simple game made using Unity.
The basic premise of the game is an infinite path with three lanes that a ball runs through with obstacles ahead that could be avoided by either stepping to the side or jumping over an obstacle, consuming ability points, but gaining score points if done successufully, if not the player loses health points.

To run this project you should add these files and run them through unity hub and use the Unity to run the game,

This project helped me understand better how to use unity and do things like object pooling to increase effeciency during run time.
